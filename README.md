$\color{gold}\large{\textbf{About this Project}}$

I developed this interactive CV using only **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**, aiming to blend simplicity with depth.  

There’s music, motion, a map of where I work… and yes, if you’re curious enough, something a little more hidden.

$\color{gold}\large{\textbf{A hint, if you're paying attention...}}$

Some things are hidden in plain sight.

> 🕵️‍♀️ **Clue:** _Try clicking my name._  
> Wait.  
> Then type what the night would say.

$\color{gold}\large{\textbf{💾 How to Use}}$


1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/cv-web-stephanie.git  
   Open index.html in your browser.  

You can replace the PDF in assets/pdf/ with your own if you wish.

$\color{lightskyblue}{\textsf{🌖 One last thing}}$  
$\color{lightskyblue}{\textsf{This page isn’t perfect.}}$  
$\color{lightskyblue}{\textsf{It wasn’t meant to be.}}$

It’s layered with intention — and mistakes.
Because I believe that what we build says more than what we claim.
And that’s what I tried to do here.

If you’re reading this far…
welcome.
